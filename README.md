# C++ Memory Interface

This application simulates the interaction between main memory and cache memory, it is possible to choose the way memory is mapped (2 way assoc, directly, full assoc), eviction mode algorithms (random/LFU/LRU). It also shows CAS/RAS latency and displays the everything in neatly arranged matrices
